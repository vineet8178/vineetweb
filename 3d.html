const concepts = [
["1. Modeling","images/Modeling.gif","Creating 3D objects.","Modeling is the foundation of 3D animation. It involves creating the geometry of all characters, props, and environments. Artists build models using polygons, vertices, and edges to form detailed structures. A well-modeled character ensures better animation and realism, while careful modeling of props and environments adds depth to the scene."],

["2. Texturing","images/Texturing.gif","Adding surface details.","Texturing is the process of painting and applying materials to 3D models to give them color, surface patterns, and realistic details. This includes skin, clothes, wood, metal, and more. Proper texturing can make a simple model appear highly realistic, and artists often use maps like diffuse, normal, and specular to control how surfaces react to light."],

["3. Rigging","images/Rigging.gif","Skeleton creation for movement.","Rigging is creating a digital skeleton or control system for 3D models. This allows animators to move characters or objects in a realistic way. Rigging involves adding joints, bones, and controllers, and sometimes facial rigs for expressions. A clean rig ensures smooth animation and prevents unnatural distortions during movement."],

["4. Animation","images/Animation.gif","Bringing objects to life.","Animation is making 3D models move over time. Animators use keyframes, motion paths, and timing to create realistic or stylized movements. This includes character acting, walk cycles, gestures, and object motion. Principles like timing, squash & stretch, and arcs are applied in 3D just as in traditional animation."],

["5. Lighting","images/Lighting.gif","Mood and realism.","Lighting in 3D is crucial for mood, atmosphere, and realism. Artists place virtual lights in the scene to simulate sunlight, lamps, or ambient light. Proper lighting highlights important areas, defines shadows, creates depth, and enhances textures. Without good lighting, even a perfectly modeled scene can look flat and unconvincing."],

["6. Rendering","images/Rendering.gif","Final image output.","Rendering converts the 3D scene into 2D images or video. This includes all geometry, textures, lighting, and animation. There are different render engines like real-time or ray-traced rendering. High-quality rendering adds realism through reflections, shadows, and effects, but it can be time-consuming depending on complexity."],

["7. Physics Simulation","images/Physics Simulation.gif","Realistic motion and interactions.","Physics simulation allows objects in 3D to move realistically according to forces like gravity, wind, or collisions. This includes cloth, hair, fluids, particles, or rigid body simulations. Physics ensures natural motion, such as a character’s hair bouncing, clothes folding, or objects colliding correctly in a scene."],

["8. Camera Animation","images/Camera Animation.gif","Dynamic viewpoint control.","Camera animation controls how the virtual camera moves through a 3D scene. Animators can create cinematic shots, pans, zooms, and tracking movements. Camera animation adds storytelling depth and perspective, allowing viewers to focus on important action or create dramatic effects."],

["9. Particle Effects","images/Particle Effects.gif","Special visual effects.","Particles simulate effects like smoke, fire, rain, explosions, dust, or magic. These effects enhance the visual richness of a scene. Particle systems allow control over size, speed, direction, color, and physics behavior. In films and games, particle effects make scenes look dynamic and alive."],

["10. Motion Capture","images/Motion Capture.gif","Capturing real-life motion.","Motion capture records movements from real actors using sensors or cameras, which are then applied to 3D characters. This saves time for complex animations, provides realistic motion, and is widely used in films, games, and VR. Artists can refine mocap data to exaggerate or stylize movements."],

["11. UV Mapping","images/UV Mapping.gif","Accurate texture placement.","UV mapping defines how 2D textures wrap around 3D models. A good UV map prevents stretching or misalignment of textures. Artists carefully unfold 3D geometry into 2D coordinates (UVs) so textures fit perfectly, making the model appear detailed and realistic."],

["12. Shading & Materials","images/Shading & Materials.gif","Surface interaction with light.","Shading determines how surfaces react to light. Materials define appearance, including color, reflectivity, transparency, glossiness, and subsurface scattering. Proper shading and materials make objects feel tangible and realistic, from shiny metal to soft skin, contributing to the overall visual quality of the animation."]
